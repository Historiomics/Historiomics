### PATINA THEORY
* The mathematical modelling of patina as surface growth process;
* Most likely, stochastic partial differential equations will be needed, something akin to interface growth models;
* The idea is to model patination as oxidation, as a rust growth process, as physical "incrustation";
* Once we adequately understand the patina growth model, it can be linked to functions of the value of patinated cultural artifacts;
* That is to say, I conjecture that there is a functional relation between the patination process and the value equation of patinated objects;
