### COURSE MATERIALS

#### INTRODUCTION
* What we are calling "CourseMats", short for "Course Materials", are "modules" if you will that can be used to teach various - mostly interdisciplinary - subjects;
* They usually consist of a bibliography, sometimes an annotated bibliography, and short "discussion"-type texts that describe how they might fit together;
* That's all it is for now. We will be elaborating on this over the course of the next short while. The idea is to have "modules" of #CourseMats that can be shared on-line, on Twitter and so forth, and that can be used to allow people to engage in conversations, again on-line, on the subject matter at hand. There's nothing more complicated about it than that. Simple "learning modules".
