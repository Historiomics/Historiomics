# Historiomics
### What is Historiomics?
- If historiography is the first derivative of history, historiomics is the second derivative of history;
- QUESTION: How does Historiomics differ from Cliometrics, Cliodynamics, or Historical Dynamics?;
- ANSWER: Historiomics generalizes to ALL manners of immutable append-only transaction logs, i.e. "Event Stores";
- Think: The algorithms of history. Historiomics studies the distributed public ledger systems across human history;
    - These include but are not limited to:
        - Culture and human history itself;
        - Science and the arts, design, engineering;
        - Traditions in general, religious and otherwise;
        - Institutions in general, religious, political, economic, social, etc.;

### A Thought Experiment
- What if we assumed a certain fiction as real and worked with that?;
- Let us assume that there are such things in "History" as "historical illnesses" or disorders/diseases;
- Let us imagine, and posit, that these fictional disorders are called "Historiopathies";
- Now let us ask the question, if such "Historiopathies" actually existed, could it also be possible, in our make-believe, fictional world, for there to be "remedies" for such historiopathic disorders?;
- Let us imagine and posit that such remedies exist, and let's call the science, or medicine, of treating historiopathies, "Historical Therapy" or "historiotherapeusis";
- This type of thought experiment was in fact the basis of an actual fictional science of historical therapy that I incorporated into a novel I began writing in the Summer of 2001, called "The History-Project";
- In the novel, researchers, thinkers, got together to work on a project, called the History-Project, whose goal was to "diagnose" and hopefully "treat" a certain "historical illness" that was affecting the people living in and around the Greater Montreal Region, in Quebec, Canada;
- The project was a complete and total failure, but as a novelist, the author of this novel, it was a "failure-by-design", i.e. it was designed to fail. So it was never proven altogether if such a science, and medical art of "historiotherapeusis" was indeed possible;
- That is to say, they had to fail so that no one could prove whether it could exist or not, at least as far as the novel was concerned;
- Coming back to reality, Historiomics is itself born from such creative work, and the question remains unanswered, but is mostly meant as a thought experiment: Can nations, peoples, entire societies or civilizations actually suffer from "Historiopathies"?;
- Historiomics, amongst other things, wants to find out.
