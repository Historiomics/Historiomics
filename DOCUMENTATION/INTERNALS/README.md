### HISTORIOMICS SYSTEM DOCUMENTATION / INTERNALS
* INTRODUCTION OF THE SYSTEMENON, a.k.a. SYSTEMS-WITH-(A)-HISTORY;
* FOUNDATION OF TYPE+ANTITYPE SYSTEM (THEORETICAL PRECURSORS/PRELIMINARIES);
* PROLEGOMENON ON HISTORIOPATHY/LOGOPATHY RELATION IN SYSTEMS-WITH-HISTORY;
* ON THE CAREFULLY SELECTED TERMINOLOGY: TO MAKE IT EASIER TO THINK COMPREHENSIVELY, SYSTEMATICALLY, ALGORITHMICALLY, COMPUTATIONALLY, TYPOLOGICALLY IN TERMS OF THE HISTORIOMICS SYSTEM (DIMINISHING COSTS OF "RAMPING UP", etc.);
* SYSTEMS DESIGNED-FOR-FAILURE, i.e. THE HISTORIOPATHY CREATING HISTORIOTOMES a.k.a. "GARBAGE-HEAPS OF HISTORY";
* "WASTE MANAGEMENT" PHILOSOPHY/METHODOLOGY FOR HISTORIOPATHIC/LOGOPATHIC PROCESSES, example: GARBAGE-TASTERS (AESTHETIC AGENTS COMPETE IN ITERATED NON-COOPERATIVE ZERO-SUM GAME AGAINST ANAESTHETIC AGENTS, "aesthesis" vs. "anaesthesis", TO BETTER DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN TYPES (AND ANTITYPES) OF GARBAGE, i.e. EVOLUTIONARY SYSTEMS OF TREATMENT OF WASTE, THE NEED FOR THINKING ABOUT NOISE/FAILURE/CRISIS etc. WITH A RIGOROUS CRITICAL-PHILOSOPHICAL METHODOLOGY, NOT JUST GOOD CODING SKILLS, THE NEED FOR PHILOSOPHY IN THE DESIGN OF COMPUTATIONAL SYSTEMS, etc., A PROFESSIONAL ETHICS OF PROGRAMMING, SO ONLY "GOOD" SYSTEMS PROPAGATE AND PERVAIL, AT LEAST IN HISTORIOMIC "SIMULATION" WORK, etc.);
* THE INTRODUCTION OF THE NEED FOR "SIGNAL SCIENCE", OF TREATING HISTORIOMIC COMPUTATIONAL SYSTEMS, AND SIMULATIONS etc., AS SIGNALING SYSTEMS WHERE THE CONCEPT OF "ANTISIGNAL" IS INTRODUCED, BECAUSE WE OBSERVED THAT THIS IS HOW IT WORKS IN NATURE, THE TYPE+ANTITYPE RELATION; HENCE, NOISE FIELD THEORY CAME OUT OF SIGNAL SCIENCE AND HISTORIOMICS TO TRY TO BETTER MANAGE "ENTROPIC" EFFECTS IF YOU WILL OF THINKING TOO MUCH PURELY OR "PURISTICALLY" IN TERMS OF THE "SYSTEM-AT-HAND", THE "SYSTEMENON" IN QUESTION, i.e. THE SYSTEM-WITH-HISTORY BEING SIMULATED, STUDIED; INTRODUCTION TO THE PROBLEM OF PARADOX IN TRADITIONS OF CRITICAL-PHILOSOPHICAL THINKING, THE FOUNDATION OF THE "CRITIQUE" COMPUTATIONAL SYSTEM WHICH IS AN ATTEMPT AT FORMALIZATION OF KANT'S CRITIQUE OF JUDGEMENT "CONSTRUCTIVELY", TO BE IMPLEMENTED AS "MODULE" IN THE HISTORIOMICS SYSTEM);
