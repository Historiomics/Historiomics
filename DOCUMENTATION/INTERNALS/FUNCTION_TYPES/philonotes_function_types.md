### PHILOSONOTES ON FUNCTION TYPES (Historiomics System)
* Universality of The No-Condition (bool);
* RESET BUTTON FUNCTIONS (Inhibition-Functions, "INHIBITORS");
* SEE: kill (commmand), EXAMPLES:
  * SIGKILL: The SIGKILL signal is sent to a process to cause it to terminate immediately (kill). In contrast to SIGTERM and SIGINT, this signal cannot be caught or ignored, and the receiving process cannot perform any clean-up upon receiving this signal.;
  * SIGTSTP: The SIGTSTP signal is sent to a process by its controlling terminal to request it to stop (terminal stop). It is commonly initiated by the user pressing Ctrl+Z. Unlike SIGSTOP, the process can register a signal handler for or ignore the signal.;
  * SIGTERM: The SIGTERM signal is sent to a process to request its termination. Unlike the SIGKILL signal, it can be caught and interpreted or ignored by the process. This allows the process to perform nice termination releasing resources and saving state if appropriate. SIGINT is nearly identical to SIGTERM.;
  * SIGINT: The SIGINT signal is sent to a process by its controlling terminal when a user wishes to interrupt the process. This is typically initiated by pressing Ctrl-C, but on some systems, the "delete" character or "break" key can be used.;
  * etc.
