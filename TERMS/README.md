## A QUICK REFERENCE OF HISTORIONAUTICS (LEXICON):
- Historiome: The "code" of population history, representing the collective memory and historical legacies of a specific group. It is shaped by the movement of people, information, and goods, forming a network of physical locations and temporal events. It is comparable to the genome in genomics. It is also described as a layered canvas or a multi-dimensional tapestry woven from individual and collective experiences. It's also described as a vast and interconnected network of historical events, patterns, and influences. 
- Antihistoriome: The shadow or negative space to the historiome, representing everything that is not strictly part of the population's historical code.
- Historiotype: A fundamental unit of historical analysis, encompassing events, records, movements, or any discernible pattern within the historiome, antihistoriome, and historiosphere. They are like genetic markers of history. They are categories or typologies used to classify and analyze recurring patterns within historical data.
- Historiotome: A "tumescent growth" or "blockage" within the flow of history, often associated with trauma, stagnation, or disruption of natural progression. They are described as "outgrowths" that hinder the smooth progression of historical energy, information, ideas, and material culture. They can be studied as distinct historical entities. They are also volumes of historical knowledge, representing large, discrete sections of history.
- Historiopathy: A disorder or "historical illness" within historical systems, characterized by dysfunctional patterns of events, ideas, or social structures.
- Historiotherapeusis: A theoretical form of "historical therapy" aimed at addressing historiopathies and restoring a healthy flow to the historical process. This may involve correcting narratives, addressing collective trauma, or finding new pathways for progress.
- Historiocode: Encoded signals from the past that contain hidden meanings or patterns.
- Historiopath: Specific pathways or trajectories taken by civilizations that lead to their success or downfall.
- Historiomorph: Evolutionary shifts in structures or forms.
- Historiotheque: A physical or conceptual space that houses historical records, acting as a "witness-box" for observing historical processes. It is a repository for artistic processes, a dynamic archive documenting experiments, reflections, and the evolution of thinking. It combines aspects of an archive, a workspace, and a site for creative exploration. It is a designated workspace that manages the flow of information related to the art operation. It is also a studio functioning as a recording studio, art studio, office, and Art Operations Control Center.
- Historiotopic Velocity: The rate of change in the Workspace's configurations with respect to time.
- Systemenon: A conceptual framework for understanding systems that evolve over time, emphasizing a systematic approach to analyzing and managing the complex interplay of historical processes within a system. It is also referred to as "Systems-with-(a)-History".
- Logopathy: A communication breakdown or distortion within historical systems, involving the misuse of language, the spread of misinformation, or the suppression of dissenting voices.
- The Art Operation: A comprehensive system encompassing philosophy, technology, and cultural critique, for creating art. It is characterized by being distributed, iterative, experimental, procedural and generative. It treats art creation as a manufacturing process with raw materials, refining processes, and outputs.
- Field Art: An artistic practice where data and materials are collected in the "field" and used as the basis for creating art in the studio.
- Database Arts: A methodology that uses databases as active, generative systems for artistic creation and knowledge production, moving beyond mere repositories of information.
- Strategic Intermedia: A methodology that uses technology and media in strategic and intentional ways to understand complex phenomena.
- Refcards: Digital index cards that hold conceptual references, allowing users to navigate complex historical information. They serve as conceptual access points to a vast network of historical knowledge, and act as nodes within that network.
- Cardbox: A network or collection of refcards.
- Project-as-Database: The concept that "projects" function as databases, with each project representing an unordered collection of artifacts grouped into series.
- Logistics of the Historiotheque: The efficient management of resources and information within the creative workspace.
- Anti-Historiotheque Project: A multi-layered, proactive system designed to mitigate the inherent dangers of the Historiotheque.
- Logonomy: The act of "meaning-giving, meaning-instituting, meaning-handing," or "to deal out meaning". It also refers to the laws governing reason, word, and speech.
- Logonomic Exhaustion: A point of depletion or exhaustion within the process of meaning-making.
- Delocalization: A process of decentralization, diffusion, and the blurring of boundaries; moving beyond the concrete and particular towards more fluid, open-ended interpretations. It is linked to "Non-Formality".
- Localization: Processes of focusing, contracting, centering, and consolidating, essentially bringing things into sharper definition and establishing boundaries.
- Physio-imaging: A concept that focuses on the body as a site where experiences are inscribed and stored. It is also described as a bioelectrical charge shaped by past experiences.
- Collabrium: A state of collaborative equilibrium that arises within a group striving towards a shared objective. It represents a state of stagnation where the collaborative process begins to deteriorate and productivity dwindles.
- Frangeme: A linguistic break or fissure that facilitates the creation of new meanings and discourses.
